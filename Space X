Mankind will begin its return to space in 2020, largely driven by the private sector. Since the Cold War, technological advances have slowed. 
Notable companies now making aerospace advancements include SpaceX and Blue Origin.
SpaceX is developing the rocket Starship, which will reuse the entire vehicle body. Starship may shorten intercontinental trips to 20-30 minutes via space. 
In China, the government and private enterprises (example: LinkSpace) are making progress in space.
5G competition between the U.S. and China is entering the main stage in 2020. 
There will be a new competition about who can propel 5G faster into mass consumer use. 
Another hot topic is the Starlink Broadband business planned by SpaceX.
Until 2020, as many as 2,500 satellites will be launched. This marks a new era of broadband Internet for some users in North America.
Starlinkâ€™s broadband Internet system will grow with 12,000 satellites through 2023, followed by the addition of 30,000 satellites.
SpaceX will provide higher speed Internet starting in 2020.
